    problem: " <p class='text-[1.5vw] mt-[2vw]'>BigBasket struggled to penetrate non-metro markets with traditional campaigns, hindering new user acquisition and growth in T2, T3, and T4 regions.</p>",
    approach: "<p class='text-[1.5vw] mt-[2vw]'>We executed a robust, data-driven PPC campaign tailored for non-metro regions. Our approach optimized creative elements and refined targeting strategies to meet local preferences. <br/> We deployed separate campaigns to allocate budget effectively across T2 and T3 cities, avoiding dilution with T1 markets. <br/>Additionally, we leveraged 1P audience signals, incorporating one-year user email IDs and contact numbers to drive high-conversion campaigns. <br/>We further ensured optimal budget allocation through detailed regional analysis, resulting in highly targeted messaging that resonated deeply with consumers across non-metro markets.</p>",
    impact: "<p class='text-[1.5vw] mt-[2vw]'>Our targeted strategy resulted in a <span class='text-primary !font-medium'> 2.35x </span> surge in installs and a <span class='text-primary !font-medium'> 2.1x </span> increase in the new customer base, dramatically expanding BigBasketâ€™s reach in non-metro markets.</p>"
